<b>Why fork?</b> The fork itself has made instructions specifically
          to build the server and run the client easily.

          <i>If the problem persists, go ask us from <a href="https://github.com/4malgama/gtanks_server_remake/issues">the original repository</a> - altrough,
          not very active.
          If the problem still persists, turns out you're dead - rebuild it again with
          proper reading skills.</i>
